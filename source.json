Players pay `enrollmentAmount` once.\r\n * - **Arming**: minimum players reached, waiting for `missionStart`.\r\n * - **Active**: `missionStart..missionEnd`. On each successful round call, one distinct player wins.\r\n * - **Paused**: enforced cooldown after a round; duration is per-mission.\r\n * - **PartlySuccess/Success/Failed**: terminal outcomes used for settlement paths.\r\n *\r\n * ## 👥 Enrollment limits (anti-addiction)\r\n * The factory enforces global weekly/monthly limits per address via `canEnroll()` and\r\n * records enrollments with `recordEnrollment()`. Helper views:\r\n * `secondsTillWeeklySlot()` and `secondsTillMonthlySlot()`.\r\n *\r\n * ## 💰 Payout model (monotonic and time-based)\r\n * Let `progress = (now - missionStart) / (missionEnd - missionStart)` (scaled).\r\n * The **cumulative entitlement** is `croStart * progress`. The round payout equals\r\n * `entitlement - paidSoFar`, clamped to `croCurrent`. A player may win **once** per mission.\r\n *\r\n * ## ⏱ Cooldowns\r\n * Two per-mission parameters are provided during creation:\r\n * - `roundPauseDuration` — cooldown after non-final rounds (seconds).\r\n * - `lastRoundPauseDuration` — cooldown before the final round (seconds).\r\n * **Note:** there are **no enforced on-chain defaults**; any “1 minute” defaults are a UI choice.\r\n *\r\n * ## 🔒 InviteOnly secret enrollment\r\n * InviteOnly missions verify a **private commitment** `_enrollSecretHash`,\r\n * computed off-chain as `keccak256(passphrase, enrollmentStart)`. The hash is stored\r\n * **privately** on the mission (not in public `MissionData`) and checked in\r\n * `enrollPlayerWithSecret(passphrase)`.\r\n *\r\n * ## 🏦 Economics & settlement\r\n * After refunds are secured/reserved:\r\n * - **InviteOnly**: **100%** of leftover goes to the **factory owner**\r\n * - **UserMission**: **50%** to the factory owner; **50%** to the **creator**\r\n * - **Other types**: **25%** to the factory owner; **75%** to the **per-type reserve**\r\n *   `reservedFunds[missionType]`.\r\n * On creating a new mission, the factory **optionally boosts** it with\r\n * `allocation = reservedFunds[type] / 4`, sent to the mission via `increasePot()`.\r\n *\r\n * ## 🧾 Ownership & authorization\r\n * The factory owner can add/remove authorized helpers and manage a two-step ownership\r\n * transfer (`proposeOwnershipTransfer` / `confirmOwnershipTransfer`). Sensitive functions\r\n * are protected by `onlyOwner`, `onlyOwnerOrAuthorized`, and `nonReentrant` where applicable.\r\n *\r\n * ## 🧭 What to look for in the code\r\n * - Factory: clone deployment, reserve accounting, enrollment limit bookkeeping,\r\n *   rich getters for dApps/indexers.\r\n * - Mission: initialize, enroll (normal & secret), round calling, cooldown checks,\r\n *   refunds, settlement routing, and detailed views for indexers.\r\n */\r\n// #endregion Introduction\r\n\r\n\r\npragma solidity ^0.8.30;\r\n\r\n\r\n// #region Imports\r\nimport \"@openzeppelin/contracts/access/Ownable.sol\";\r\nimport \"@openzeppelin/contracts/proxy/Clones.sol\";\r\nimport \"@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/ReentrancyGuard.sol\";\r\n// #endregion\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n// #region Global Enums\r\n/**\r\n * @dev Enum to represent the type of mission.\r\n * The mission can be one of several types: Custom, Hourly, QuarterDaily, BiDaily, Daily, Weekly, or Monthly.\r\n * The default use for each type is defined in the comments but is set in the dApp UI and can vary.\r\n */\r\nenum MissionType {\r\n    Custom,         // No default use, completely custom\r\n    Hourly,         // Default use:  1 day  enrollment, 1 hour arming,  1 hour  rounds\r\n    QuarterDaily,   // Default use:  1 day  enrollment, 1 hour arming,  6 hours rounds\r\n    BiDaily,        // Default use:  1 day  enrollment, 1 hour arming, 12 hours rounds\r\n    Daily,          // Default use:  1 day  enrollment, 1 hour arming, 24 hours rounds\r\n    Weekly,         // Default use:  1 week enrollment, 1 hour arming,  7 days  rounds\r\n    Monthly,        // Default use:  1 week enrollment, 1 hour arming, 30 days  rounds\r\n    InviteOnly,     // Default use:  Custom enrollment, custom arming,   custom rounds\r\n    UserMission     // Default use:  Custom enrollment, custom arming,   custom rounds\r\n}\r\n\r\n/**\r\n * @dev Enum to represent the status of a mission.\r\n * The mission can be in one of several states: Pending, Enrolling, Active, Paused, Ended, or Failed.\r\n */\r\nenum Status     {\r\n    Pending,        // Mission is created but not yet enrolling\r\n    Enrolling,      // Mission is open for enrollment, waiting for players to join\r\n    Arming,         // Mission is armed and ready to start\r\n    Active,         // Mission is currently active and players can participate\r\n    Paused,         // Mission is paused, no further actions can be taken\r\n    PartlySuccess,  // Mission has ended with some players winning, but not all rounds were claimed\r\n    Success,        // Mission has ended successfully, all rounds were claimed\r\n    Failed          // Mission has failed, no players won or not enough players enrolled\r\n}\r\n\r\n/**\r\n * @dev Enum to represent the enrollment limits for a mission.\r\n * The limits can be None, Weekly, or Monthly.\r\n */\r\nenum Limit      { \r\n    None,       // No limit breached\r\n    Weekly,     // Weekly limit breached\r\n    Monthly     // Monthly limit breached\r\n}\r\n// #endregion\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n// #region Contr.
