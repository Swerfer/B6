Thanks, that gives a clear picture. I’ll begin researching a step-by-step implementation plan for your mission game page and background service, including:

* A backend C# service for polling the smart contract.
* A suitable, license-free or permissively licensed database alternative to SQL Server Express.
* A recommended real-time push strategy (likely comparing WebSockets vs polling).
* Frontend UX/logic for switching between multiple active missions the player joined.

I’ll get back to you shortly with a structured plan and implementation breakdown.


# Technical Implementation Plan for Web3 Mission Game DApp 

This plan outlines a comprehensive approach to implement both the **game frontend** and a **C# backend service** for a Web3-based mission game DApp on the Cronos blockchain. We cover the system architecture, data flows, UI structure for managing multiple missions, real-time update mechanisms, database choice/structure, background service logic, and smart contract integration best practices. The goal is to enable players to seamlessly: select and join missions, monitor mission progress (with timers), trigger rounds when eligible, and view results through to mission completion, all with real-time responsiveness.

## Backend Architecture Overview

The backend consists of a **C# service** running on Windows Server 2022 (hosted under IIS as an ASP.NET Core application). Its primary roles are to interface with the on-chain **MissionFactory** and Mission contracts on Cronos, maintain an off-chain state in a database, and push real-time updates to clients. Key components and their tasks include:

* **Blockchain Interface (Web3 Integration):** Using a library like Nethereum, the service connects to a Cronos node (via JSON-RPC HTTP or WebSocket) to call contract methods and listen for events. This enables reading mission data (enrollments, status, rounds) and invoking transactions if needed. Nethereum simplifies contract calls by handling ABI encoding/decoding and Ethereum-compatible RPC calls.

* **Background Polling Workers:** The service runs scheduled tasks to poll the blockchain at different intervals:

  * *Mission Monitor:* Every 5 seconds, poll each mission that is in an ongoing state (Active or Paused) for status and state changes.
  * *Factory Monitor:* Every 60 seconds, poll the MissionFactory for new missions (those still in enrollment phase) or changes in mission statuses. This catches missions that have just been created or have just progressed from enrollment to active.

* **Local Database (Off-chain Storage):** A database caches mission metadata and state to avoid repeated chain queries and to support queries (like listing missions). On mission creation, the service records details (mission address, name, type, enrollment end time, etc.). During gameplay, it updates dynamic fields (e.g., status, player count, rounds completed). This off-chain store acts as the source for the frontend’s queries and can be easily filtered or aggregated without hitting the blockchain.

* **Web Server & API:** The ASP.NET Core service can expose Web API endpoints (e.g., to fetch mission lists or join statuses if needed) and will host a **SignalR hub** for real-time communication. SignalR (which uses WebSockets under the hood) is integrated into the .NET stack, enabling low-latency push updates from server to client. The service uses this to broadcast mission events (status changes, new round results, etc.) to connected players.

* **Push Notification Hub:** Clients maintain a WebSocket connection (via SignalR) to receive updates. The backend groups connections by mission or user so that updates are only sent to relevant players (e.g., players in mission X get that mission’s updates). This publish-subscribe model ensures efficient, real-time delivery without polling from the client. SignalR is well-suited here as it supports high-frequency server updates ideal for gaming scenarios.

Overall, the backend acts as a **bridge between the blockchain and players**, offloading heavy state tracking from the client and enabling a responsive UI.

## Frontend Structure & Layout (Multi-Mission Management)

The frontend will be a web page (DApp interface) that allows the player to manage multiple joined missions and engage with new ones. The UI is structured to make it easy to switch between missions and focus on one at a time:

* **Mission Selection View:** Initially, the player is presented with a list of available missions that are open for enrollment (active missions in pre-`enrollmentEnd` phase). This can be shown as a list or grid of “Joinable Missions”, each displaying basic info (mission name, type, current players vs. required minimum, enrollment deadline countdown, entry fee, etc.). From here, a user can select a mission to view details and enroll.

* **“My Missions” Dashboard:** Once the player has joined one or more missions, the UI will emphasize those missions. Only missions the user is enrolled in will appear in their personal mission list (per the requirement). The DApp can query the blockchain via the factory’s view function `getPlayerParticipation(address)` to get all missions a player is in, along with their current status and names. Using this, the frontend can populate a sidebar or menu of “My Missions” for the connected wallet. Each item shows the mission name (and perhaps a status badge: Enrolling, Active, etc.).

* **Mission Detail Panel:** The main content area is dedicated to one mission at a time (the player can select which one from the list). This panel displays comprehensive details:

  * **Enrollment Phase:** If the mission is still in enrollment and the player has not yet joined, show the countdown to enrollment end, number of players enrolled vs. needed, and a **“Join Mission”** button. The join action will trigger a smart contract transaction (using the user’s Web3 wallet) to enroll. If the player already enrolled, indicate their enrollment and perhaps disable the join button.
  * **Active Phase:** Once a mission is active (rounds in progress), show the mission’s progress: current round number out of total, the mission timer (time remaining until missionEnd), and any cooldown timer until the next round can be called. A log or list of past rounds’ results should be updated in real-time (e.g., “Round 2: Winner – 0xABC...1234 won 50 CRO”). This can be built from the mission’s `playersWon` array (which contains each round’s winner and amount) or pushed from the backend when a round completes. If the mission is currently eligible for the next round (cooldown elapsed), enable a **“Trigger Round”** button for the player to call the round. The UI should only allow this if the rules permit (e.g., using contract data to check timing or a backend signal that the round is ready).
  * **Paused/Arming:** If the mission is temporarily paused or in an “arming” delay (e.g., a waiting period after enrollment or before final round), show a clear message or timer counting down to when play will resume. During this state, action buttons would be disabled.
  * **Mission Ended:** After all rounds are done or the mission time has elapsed, display an **End-of-Mission summary**. This includes final status (Success, PartlySuccess, or Failed), and a recap of winners for each round (and any unclaimed prize handling if applicable). For example, list each round with the winner and payout, or a statement if the mission failed (not enough players, all enrollments refunded).

* **Easy Mission Switching:** To let users switch between multiple missions they’ve joined, the UI can use a tabbed interface or a sidebar selection. For instance, a sidebar listing “Mission A, Mission B, …” where clicking one brings its details into the main panel. The state of each mission (e.g., an active mission might highlight if a round is ready) could be indicated with icons or colors, prompting the user’s attention. This way, a player in two missions can quickly toggle views. The switching should maintain any ongoing data (e.g., do not require full page reload; use JavaScript to swap content).

* **Responsive Updates:** The frontend will receive real-time updates via the WebSocket connection to reflect changes without the user refreshing or constantly polling. This includes:

  * Updating timers/countdowns (these can also tick on the client side every second for smoothness, with the server occasionally sending time syncs or events when a deadline is reached).
  * Adding a new round result to the log as soon as a round is triggered by *any* player.
  * Changing the mission status label (e.g., from Enrolling to Active to Ended) the moment it happens on-chain.
  * Notifying the user (could be a subtle alert or highlight) if a mission transitions to a state that needs their action (e.g., “Mission X is now active. Round 1 can be triggered!”).

Under the hood, the frontend uses Ethers.js and Web3Modal (as indicated by the included scripts) for blockchain interactions and wallet connectivity. The page can leverage these to call read-only contract functions (using a read-only RPC endpoint) and to send transactions for enroll or round triggers via the user’s wallet. The layout is built with standard HTML/CSS (Bootstrap is loaded for styling), meaning we can use responsive grid and component classes to organize the content. Short, clear sections and possibly modals (for confirmations or alerts) will be used to keep the UI intuitive.

## Real-Time Data Flow Strategy

Achieving real-time responsiveness is critical for a good user experience in this mission game. The strategy combines frequent blockchain polling on the backend with WebSocket push updates to clients, avoiding client-side polling where possible. Below is the data flow for key scenarios, and the reasoning behind using WebSockets over traditional polling:

* **Mission Status Changes:** When a mission’s state changes (e.g., enrollment closes and mission becomes active, or a mission ends), the Mission contract invokes `MissionFactory.setMissionStatus` which updates the status mapping. The backend’s polling loop (monitoring active/enrolling missions) will catch this change within its next cycle (5s for active missions, or on the next 1min factory poll for newly active missions). Upon detecting a status change, the backend updates the mission’s status in the DB and immediately emits a WebSocket message to all clients interested in that mission. The players’ UIs receive this message and update the status label and any UI elements accordingly (for example, the “Enroll” section is replaced with the live round view when a mission moves from Enrolling to Active).

* **Round Trigger and Results:** A round can be triggered by any enrolled player calling the appropriate function on the mission contract (likely a function that selects a winner and distributes payout). When this happens:

  1. The player’s frontend calls the contract via their wallet. Once the transaction is mined on Cronos, the on-chain state updates (e.g., `roundCount` increments, a winner is added to `playersWon`, CRO balances change, etc., and a `RoundCalled` event is emitted by the contract).
  2. The backend poller (which runs every 5 seconds for active missions) will very quickly notice the change. It may detect an increased round count or simply call a view like `getMissionData` and see the updated `playersWon` list length. The service can also retrieve the details of the last round (e.g., the latest entry in `playersWon` struct array containing winner address and amount).
  3. The backend then writes the round result to the database (for record-keeping) and pushes a **real-time notification** via SignalR to the mission’s group. This message could contain the round number, winner’s shortened address, and payout amount.
  4. All clients in that mission group instantly receive the message. Their UI JavaScript will append a new entry to the round results log (e.g., “Round 3: 0x1234…abcd wins 25 CRO”), update the remaining pot or round counter if shown, and potentially play an animation or highlight to draw attention to the update. This happens within a second or two of the block confirmation, providing near-instant feedback to all players.
  5. Additionally, if the round triggered was the final round of the mission, the backend will also detect that the mission has now ended (status changes to Success or PartlySuccess). It will push another update for mission completion, so the UI can transition to the end-of-mission summary state.

* **New Mission Available:** When a new mission contract is created via the factory, a `MissionCreated` event is emitted on-chain. The backend’s factory poll (every 60s) will catch the new mission (either by reading the total missions count or filtering missions by status Enrolling). It then queries the new mission’s details (name, type, enrollment deadline, etc.), stores them, and could notify connected clients (e.g., if there’s a lobby view of open missions, the server can broadcast an update like “Mission X (Weekly) is now open for enrollment”). Clients could then display this new mission in the selection list in real-time. (If mission creation is rare or not time-sensitive, this push may be optional and the client could just refresh the list periodically. But it’s easy to support via the same push mechanism.)

* **Timers and Countdown Updates:** For countdowns (enrollment end time, mission end time, round cooldowns), the exact end timestamp is known from contract data (e.g., `enrollmentEnd` in the mission). The backend will still send events at significant moments, like “enrollment period over” or “round available now.” However, updating a countdown every second via server push would be inefficient. Instead, the frontend will handle the **per-second countdown updates locally** (using JavaScript timers) for smoothness. The server ensures the client is aware of the correct target time. For example, if the backend pushes a message “Mission active, next round can be triggered at \[time X]”, the client sets a timer to count down to X. If the round is triggered earlier by someone, the server push for the round event will effectively override the timer (the UI will reset to the next stage immediately). This hybrid approach gives real-time reactivity without flooding the network with updates.

**WebSockets vs. Polling:** We recommend a WebSocket-based push approach (implemented via SignalR) for this DApp’s real-time needs. In a gaming context where state changes must propagate instantly to all players, server push is far superior to client polling. Polling the server from each client every few seconds would be resource-intensive and still introduce latency. By contrast, SignalR allows the server to push updates **immediately** as events occur, enabling “instant updates from the server to the client” with minimal latency. SignalR is a natural fit since the backend is .NET and it provides built-in support for high-frequency updates (it was designed for scenarios like real-time gaming dashboards). It also handles scaling and fallback (it will use WebSockets if available, or fall back to Server-Sent Events/long-polling automatically, ensuring compatibility across browsers).

One consideration is the reliability of blockchain event capture. Pure WebSocket subscriptions to blockchain events can miss data if a connection drops. Our approach mitigates that by using a combination of **polling to ensure no missed events** and WebSocket push to clients for timeliness. The backend essentially acts as a reliable proxy: even if a temporary network issue occurs, the next poll will catch any state changes that were missed in real-time, and the server can still update the clients (albeit a few seconds later). This gives us the best of both worlds – accuracy and real-time speed.

In summary, the data flow is: **on-chain event -> backend detects via polling -> backend updates DB + pushes update via WebSocket -> frontend updates UI.** Clients themselves do minimal polling (perhaps only for initial data load or as a fallback), relying mostly on the server to feed changes. This strategy will make the user experience feel instantaneous and synchronized for all players.

## Database Selection & Schema

For the off-chain database, we need a solution that is **free for commercial use** and capable of handling the modest data needs of the game. We recommend using an open-source RDBMS such as **PostgreSQL** or **MySQL/MariaDB** over SQL Server Express. PostgreSQL in particular is a strong choice: it is completely free for both personal and commercial use (licensed under a permissive open-source license), without the size or performance limitations that come with SQL Express. (By contrast, SQL Server Express imposes a 10 GB size cap per database and other resource limits, which could become a bottleneck as the game grows.) Using PostgreSQL avoids these constraints while providing enterprise-grade reliability and scalability.

**Database Schema:** The database will store persistent data about missions and potentially player enrollments. A possible schema breakdown:

* **Missions Table:** Each row represents a mission (a cloned Mission contract instance).

  * `MissionAddress` (PK): the unique address of the mission contract (string).
  * `Name`: mission name (string) – obtained from the factory at creation.
  * `Type`: mission type (enum or tinyint) – corresponds to the `MissionType` (e.g., 0=Custom, 1=Hourly, etc.).
  * `EnrollmentFee`: the CRO fee required to enroll (decimal or bigint for wei).
  * `EnrollmentStart` and `EnrollmentEnd` (datetime or Unix timestamp): enrollment window. These define when the mission is open for joining.
  * `EnrollmentMaxPlayers` / `MinPlayers`: limits on number of players.
  * `MissionStart` and `MissionEnd` (datetime): the scheduled start and end of the mission’s active phase. These may be derived from type defaults or set during creation.
  * `MissionRoundsTotal`: total number of payout rounds in the mission.
  * `CurrentRoundCount`: number of rounds that have been completed/claimed so far (updated as rounds occur).
  * `Status`: current status of the mission (e.g., Enrolling, Active, Paused, Success, Failed). This can be stored as a small int or string. It’s updated by the service as the mission progresses.
  * `LastUpdateTime`: timestamp of the last on-chain update we recorded (optional, for internal use).

  Additionally, one might store fields like `IsArmed` or flags if a mission was canceled or needs admin intervention, but the above covers the basics.

* **PlayerEnrollments (optional):** If we want to query which missions a given player has joined without always hitting the chain, we could maintain an enrollment table:

  * `Id` (PK auto)
  * `MissionAddress` (FK to Missions)
  * `PlayerAddress` (the user’s wallet address)
  * `EnrollTime` (when they joined)

  The service would insert into this table whenever it detects (via event or polling) that a player enrolled. However, maintaining this might be redundant since the contract can give us this info on demand. If we expect a need for complex queries (like listing the top players or sending notifications, etc.), an enrollments table is useful. Otherwise, the frontend can use the factory’s `getPlayerParticipation` as noted earlier.

* **RoundResults (optional):** This table would store the outcome of each round for historical/audit purposes and easy display:

  * `MissionAddress` (FK)
  * `RoundNumber` (1, 2, 3, …)
  * `WinnerAddress`
  * `PrizeAmount`
  * `Timestamp` (when the round was triggered, i.e., block time)

  The service would add an entry here when a round is called (from event data or after reading `playersWon` new entry). This makes it straightforward to query and display all winners of a mission. It’s optional because the same data is on-chain (and accessible via `getWinners()` view or the `playersWon` array), but having it locally can simplify generating end-of-mission reports or any off-chain analytics.

* **MissionFactory Meta (optional):** We might also store a single-row table for factory-level info (like total missions created, global enrollment limits, etc.), though these can be fetched on the fly. This is not strictly necessary for core functionality.

The database schema should be designed with indexing on important fields: for example, index `Status` in the Missions table to quickly find all Active missions to poll, or index `PlayerAddress` in enrollments if we implement that, to query a player’s missions. The volume of data is expected to be manageable (even 1000 missions and a few thousand enrollments is trivial for Postgres/MySQL).

**Why SQL and not NoSQL:** A relational database fits well because the data is structured (missions, players, rounds) and we want to perform relationships (like join missions to players). It also ensures consistency — e.g., if we update a mission’s status and add a round result, those can be in one transaction. Open-source SQL databases also have robust tooling and are familiar to developers.

**Concurrency and consistency:** Since the backend service is the only writer to the database (players do not write directly to it, they interact via the blockchain), we don’t expect complex concurrent write scenarios. The service can safely upsert mission records and insert round results as it processes blockchain updates. If multiple threads are polling simultaneously, using transactions or simple locking when updating the same mission record will prevent race conditions (e.g., two nearly-simultaneous poll cycles). The design can be kept simple: one thread or task loop can handle all mission updates sequentially given the short intervals.

In summary, a **PostgreSQL database** is recommended for its free commercial use and no size limit, with a schema centered on Missions and related tables. This will efficiently support the DApp’s data needs now and scale as the number of missions and players grows.

## C# Background Service Design & Polling Logic

The C# backend is implemented as a continuously running background service (which can be hosted within an ASP.NET Core application under IIS). Its design ensures that it systematically monitors the blockchain state and reacts to it. The core of this service is two polling loops (for missions and factory), plus logic to handle the retrieved data. Here’s how to implement it step by step:

* **Initialize Web3 Connection:** On startup, the service creates a Web3 client using Nethereum (or a similar Web3 library), pointing to a Cronos RPC endpoint. For reliability, this could include both an HTTP provider (for regular calls) and a WebSocket provider (if we choose to subscribe to some events). The Cronos RPC URL and the MissionFactory contract address/ABI are loaded from configuration. For example, use `web3 = new Web3("<Cronos RPC URL>");` and have Nethereum generate contract wrappers or use `Contract` class with the ABI to call functions.

* **Load Existing Missions:** The service starts by loading any existing missions from the blockchain or database. For instance, it can call `getMissionsNotEnded()` on the factory to get all missions that are not finished (which includes those Enrolling, Arming, Active, Paused). It compares these with what’s in the database to add any missions not yet tracked. Similarly, it might mark missions that are ended in DB if they no longer appear (though ended missions could also be captured via status or a separate call `getMissionsEnded()` if available). This initial sync ensures the DB is up-to-date when the service begins polling in earnest.

* **Poller for Active/Paused Missions (5s loop):** This is a high-frequency loop to keep real-time track of ongoing games:

  * Every 5 seconds (using a timer or an async loop with `Task.Delay(5000)`), for each mission currently marked as Active or Paused in the DB, do the following:

    1. **Retrieve current status:** Call the mission’s `getRealtimeStatus()` view function (which likely returns the Status enum). This accounts for time-based changes (the contract may report `Active` vs `PartlySuccess` depending on block timestamps, etc.). If the status has changed from what’s in our DB (e.g., mission went from Active to Success/Failed), update the DB record. If it transitioned to an end state (Success, PartlySuccess, or Failed), handle end-of-mission (discussed below).
    2. **If still Active/Paused:** Fetch relevant mission state. To minimize calls, one approach is to use a single `getMissionData()` call that returns a comprehensive tuple of mission info including round counts, players, winners, etc. From this:

       * Check `roundCount` (number of rounds completed) vs. our stored value. If `roundCount` increased, it means a new round just finished. Determine the new round number = `roundCount`, and fetch the details of that round. The `playersWon` array (either from `getMissionData` or by calling a dedicated `getWinners()` view) will contain the winners; the newest entry `playersWon[last]` gives the latest winner address and amount. Extract those details.
       * Update the mission’s `CurrentRoundCount` in DB and insert a new RoundResults record (mission, round#, winner, amount, timestamp). The timestamp could be obtained by calling `block.timestamp` via an RPC call for the block of the round event, or by simply using the server’s current time as an approximation (since rounds are triggered by transactions, the exact time is less critical than the order and result).
       * Check if the mission’s pot or `croCurrent` (remaining prize pool) changed if that’s of interest – this likely changes when a round pays out. If tracking that, update it too (optional).
       * If a mission is in a Paused state (which might indicate a scheduled pause before final round or a manual pause), still poll it. The logic is similar: watch for status changes or admin actions. For example, if Paused due to a cooldown, after the cooldown duration the contract might still report Active or allow a round – the service can detect time passed and perhaps update status via getRealtimeStatus.
    3. **Check for round triggers availability:** Although not strictly required (the client can determine if the cooldown timer elapsed), the backend can provide an extra service: if a mission is Active and not all rounds are done, it can compute if a round is currently triggerable. For instance, if `lastRoundTime` (time of last round or mission start) + cooldown <= now, then a new round can be called. The service could then push a message like “Mission X: Next round is now available to trigger!” to all players in that mission. This is a nice-to-have push notification that alerts players immediately when they *could* call the round. To implement this, the service needs to track `lastRoundTime`. This might come from the RoundCalled event timestamp or simply use the local time when it detected a new round (assuming near real-time detection, that’s close enough). Because the cooldowns are short (5 minutes), a few seconds of skew doesn’t hurt. Alternatively, it might be simpler to let the frontends handle this with their own timer since they know the cooldown interval (the contract code likely has constants for 5 min normal round cooldown, 1 min final round cooldown).
    4. **Push updates to clients:** Based on the above checks, the service will use SignalR to notify clients:

       * If a new round happened: send a message to the mission’s group with the round number, winner, and prize. For example, a SignalR hub method `RoundResult(missionId, roundNumber, winnerAddress, amount)` that clients handle by updating their UI.
       * If the mission status changed (to Paused, Resumed, Ended, etc.): send a message to update status. E.g., `MissionStatusChanged(missionId, newStatus)` so the UI can reflect it (and possibly change UI flow if it’s an end state).
       * If a round becomes available (from the optional check above): send a notification event that could trigger a visual cue (like enabling the “Trigger” button or highlighting the mission tab for the user).
    5. **End-of-Mission handling:** If a mission is detected to have ended (Status now Success, PartlySuccess, or Failed):

       * Mark it as ended in DB (we could also record whether it was successful or not).
       * Fetch final data if needed (final list of winners, etc.) and store it or send it out.
       * Remove the mission from the active polling list (so we stop polling it every 5s, saving resources).
       * Push a final update to clients in that mission, e.g., `MissionEnded(missionId, finalStatus)` possibly along with summary info (the client can also retrieve summary via an API call or just already have all round results from prior pushes).
       * If the mission failed (not enough players), the service might call `refundPlayers()` on the contract (if such admin action is needed and if the service is authorized to). However, best practice is that refunds can be triggered trustlessly by users or automatically by contract. The contract *does* have a `refundPlayers()` function, which likely needs to be called if mission fails. If the service is set as an authorized address on the factory, it could detect a Failed status and call `refundPlayers()` via an owner key. This is an advanced step and should be done carefully (requires storing a private key and ensuring secure transaction submission). If implemented, that call would be in this end-of-mission branch.

  This 5-second loop should be implemented as an asynchronous task that handles all active missions relatively quickly. If there are many missions, consider polling them in parallel (e.g., use `Task.WhenAll` on a set of contract calls) to keep the cycle within 5 seconds. In practice, if only a handful of missions are active at once, sequential polling is fine.

* **Poller for New/Enrolling Missions (60s loop):** The second loop runs less frequently (every 1 minute) to discover new missions and watch enrollment-phase missions:

  * Call `MissionFactory.getMissionsByStatus(1)` where status 1 corresponds to Enrolling (or use a similar view that lists active enrollment missions). This returns arrays of mission addresses, their status (should be 1 for all if filtering by status), and names. Alternatively, use `getAllMissions()` or track the total count via `getTotalMissions()` and query newly added ones.
  * For each mission in Enrolling:

    * If it’s not already in our database, it’s a newly created mission. Add a record to Missions table with all its details. You’d get the name and status from the factory call; additional info like enrollment deadlines, fees, etc., require calling the mission’s `getMissionData()` or a specific view (since the factory likely doesn’t provide those). So immediately call `missionContract.getMissionData()` for the new mission to grab its parameters (this is a one-time cost per new mission). Store those in DB.
    * Start tracking this mission for status changes. Technically, during enrollment, nothing changes except player count. We are not polling every 5s for Enrolling missions (to keep load down). However, we **do** want to know when enrollment ends. We can rely on time for that: the `EnrollmentEnd` time is known from the data. The service could schedule a one-time check at `EnrollmentEnd` (e.g., compare it to current time each loop iteration, and if now past the deadline, mark this mission as potentially starting).
    * Also, check if the mission reached minimum players and the enrollment period ended – which means it should transition to Active (or “Arming”) status. The contract might only change status to Active when the mission actually starts (maybe after a short arming period). To ensure we don’t miss the start, once enrollment is over, add this mission to the 5-second Active poll loop (even if it might still say “Enrolling” or “Arming” for a short time, we’ll catch the exact moment it flips to Active).
    * If a mission is in Enrolling and fails (not enough players by deadline), it might automatically set status to Failed or requires a call. In either case, on the next poll it would drop out of `getMissionsByStatus(1)`. We should then query its status (perhaps via `missionStatus` mapping in factory) to see if it’s Failed, update DB, and treat it as ended (and possibly handle refunds as above).
  * The factory poll also helps catch missions that might have started while the service was down for a bit. For example, if the service restarts, it might find a mission that is already Active but not in DB. Since `getMissionsNotEnded()` returns all non-finalized missions, the service can use that to sync missing ones.
  * Additionally, use the factory poll to monitor global state if needed (e.g., if the factory has a global enrollment limit or reserved funds pool, you might update those in a dashboard).

* **Error Handling and Resilience:** Both loops should be robust to RPC errors or timeouts. If a call fails (network glitch, node down), catch the exception and perhaps log it. The loop can continue, or if the RPC endpoint is unreachable, back off and retry. Using a secondary RPC endpoint (fallback node) is a good practice for resilience. Since this is a long-running service, also guard against memory leaks and use efficient data structures for tracked missions (e.g., a dictionary of missionAddress -> lastKnownState to quickly lookup without excessive DB queries).

* **Integration with SignalR:** Within the ASP.NET Core app, the background service can get a handle to the SignalR hub context (e.g., via dependency injection of `IHubContext<GameHub>`) in order to send messages outside of HTTP request context. For example, after updating the database and determining what messages to send, do something like:

  ```csharp
  await hubContext.Clients.Group(missionId).SendAsync("RoundResult", missionId, roundNum, winnerAddr, amount);
  ```

  This will push the `RoundResult` event to all clients in that mission’s group. Similarly for status changes:

  ```csharp
  await hubContext.Clients.Group(missionId).SendAsync("StatusChanged", missionId, newStatus);
  ```

  On the client side, the SignalR client would be set up to listen for these events and call the appropriate JS functions to update the UI.

* **Deployment:** Running under IIS, ensure the app is configured as “Always Running” (so the background service isn’t halted by app pool recycles). Alternatively, this could run as a Windows Service/daemon outside of IIS if we wanted to separate the web serving from the polling. However, combining them (a web app with background tasks) is convenient for a unified deployment. If scaling out to multiple server instances, note that multiple parallel pollers would need coordination (to prevent duplicate work). In that scenario, one might run a single instance of the background service (or use distributed locks or make polling idempotent). But for a single-server setup, it’s straightforward.

To summarize, the background service uses **polling loops** to reliably track game state, which are straightforward to implement and ensure we don’t miss events even if a WebSocket subscription could drop. It maintains an updated database and uses that to drive real-time notifications to players. This design trades a small amount of RPC load for simplicity and reliability, which is acceptable for the expected scale. (If performance becomes an issue, we could incorporate event subscriptions to reduce the polling frequency — for instance, subscribe to `MissionCreated`, `MissionStatusChanged`, and `RoundCalled` events via WebSocket to get immediate notification, and use polling as a backup. Nethereum supports such subscriptions and streaming of events without polling, but careful handling is needed to avoid missed data on disconnects.)

## Smart Contract Interaction Best Practices

Interacting with the Cronos (Ethereum-compatible) smart contracts from the C# backend and the web client requires careful consideration for security and reliability. Here are best practices to follow:

* **Use Established Libraries:** Utilize well-tested libraries like **Nethereum** (for C#) and **Ethers.js** (for the web) to handle the low-level details of encoding calls, managing data types (e.g., big integers, addresses), and interfacing with RPC endpoints. These libraries also often include the ABI definitions and can generate strongly-typed contract classes, reducing errors in calling contract functions.

* **ABI and Contract Management:** Keep the ABI definitions for MissionFactory and Mission contracts in a single source of truth (the frontend already has them in `core.js`, and the backend should have the same for Nethereum). This avoids mismatches. Store contract addresses (factory address, etc.) in a configuration file or environment variable – do not hardcode them in multiple places, to easily update if contracts redeploy.

* **Read vs. Write Operations:** **Reads (constant/view calls)** can be done freely from both backend and frontend. They do not cost gas and do not require a signed transaction. However, to avoid unnecessary load on the RPC, prefer the backend to handle repetitive reads (like status polls) and then distribute results to clients, instead of every client querying the blockchain separately. The frontend can still directly call one-off views for quick data (e.g., confirming their own enrollment status or using `getPlayerParticipation` to list their missions on login). **Writes (transactions)**, such as enrolling in a mission or triggering a round, should generally be done by the user through their wallet – this ensures the user pays the gas and signs with their private key. The backend should not hold user private keys. The only exception is if certain admin functions (like ending a stuck mission or withdrawing funds) need to be automated; in that case, store the admin key securely (environment/keystore) and use it with Nethereum’s account integration to send transactions. Always use testnets and small amounts to verify the logic before using the real key.

* **Handling Blockchain Nuances:**

  * **Confirmations:** When a user triggers a round or enrolls, the frontend will send the transaction and typically show a pending state (e.g., “Transaction pending…”). The backend, upon detecting the result in a subsequent poll, will broadcast the confirmed outcome. Design the UI to handle this: show a loading indicator until the backend push or a certain number of blocks confirm. This prevents double-counting or race conditions (e.g., if two players try to trigger a round at almost the same time, one will succeed and one will get a revert; the backend will only announce the actual success).
  * **Reorgs:** Cronos is an EVM chain, so minor chain reorganizations are possible but rare. Since we rely mostly on polling latest state (which will reflect any reorg final result) rather than reacting to event immediately at one-block time, we naturally get a more stable view. If we do use any event subscriptions, consider waiting for a few block confirmations or cross-checking via polling before acting on it.
  * **Rate Limiting:** Be mindful of RPC rate limits if using a public endpoint. Polling every 5 seconds per active mission is fine for a handful of missions, but if this scales, consider hosting your own node or using a provider with WebSocket support to subscribe to events. Monitor for any signs of throttling and adjust intervals if needed.

* **Smart Contract Constraints:** Validate through the contract’s view functions before allowing certain actions:

  * Before letting a user enroll, the frontend or backend can call `canEnroll(address)` on the factory to ensure the player hasn’t hit weekly/monthly limits and that enrollment is open. This prevents wasting gas on a failing transaction.
  * Before triggering a round, check if the mission’s state allows it (e.g., not paused, cooldown passed). The backend could expose an API or push an event when it is okay to trigger, as mentioned. Also handle the case where two triggers happen: the contract likely will only accept one – so the UI should handle a failure (perhaps by simply relying on the backend update to know if you won or not).
  * The contract’s security (reentrancy guards, etc.) are in place, but from the app side, ensure you handle failures gracefully. For instance, if a `triggerRound` transaction fails due to someone else beating you to it, catch that error in the web3 callback and simply refresh state (the round likely got triggered by the other person).

* **Database Transactions & Consistency:** When the backend writes to the database in response to a blockchain event, ensure that each logical update (e.g., “round X happened, mission status updated”) is done in a transaction. This way, if the app crashes or loses connectivity mid-update, you won’t end up with partially applied state (e.g., round result recorded but mission status not updated). This also helps maintain consistency between what’s in the DB and what’s on-chain.

* **Security:**

  * Never expose your RPC endpoint or private keys to the client side. The frontend should use its own provider (like the user’s wallet or a limited Infura endpoint for reads). The backend’s connection info and any keys remain server-side.
  * If the backend uses an owner key for admin actions, restrict those actions. For example, only trigger an automatic `forceFinalizeMission()` if absolutely necessary (and maybe have it require certain conditions to avoid abuse). Keep the private key encrypted and use .NET Secret Manager or Azure Key Vault if possible when deploying.
  * Validate inputs on any API endpoints the backend provides. Although most data comes from the blockchain or config, if there are endpoints (e.g., to query missions by player), ensure the player address provided is well-formed, etc., to prevent injection or overuse.

* **Testing and Simulation:** Before going live, simulate the mission lifecycle:

  1. Deploy contracts on Cronos testnet.
  2. Run the backend service connected to testnet.
  3. Simulate a mission: create a mission via the factory (maybe using a script or via the DApp UI), have multiple test addresses enroll, advance the time or call rounds to simulate the active phase, and ensure the backend and frontend respond correctly (statuses change, rounds show up, etc.).
  4. Test edge cases: mission fails to meet min players (ensure refunds happen or at least state moves to Failed), mission where all rounds get claimed quickly (should end in Success early, before `missionEnd`), mission paused manually (if that feature is used).
  5. Measure the performance of the polling under these tests and adjust intervals if needed.

* **Future Improvement (Events vs Polling):** As a potential optimization, keep an eye on Nethereum’s subscription features. Using WebSockets, one can subscribe to contract events so that the node pushes events to the service in real-time. For example, subscribe to `MissionFactory.MissionCreated` and each Mission’s `RoundCalled` and `MissionStatusChanged` events. This can supplement or replace some polling. However, remember the warning that if the connection drops, you might miss events. A best practice in a robust system is to use event subscriptions for immediate updates **and** do periodic polling as a safety net to reconcile any missed data (exactly what our design does, effectively). This dual approach ensures accuracy.

* **Logging and Monitoring:** Implement logging in the backend service for important actions: when a mission is added, when a status change or round is detected and pushed, etc. This will help in debugging if something goes wrong (for example, if a round wasn’t detected, you can inspect logs to see if the poll ran or if an exception happened). Also, monitoring the health of the service (perhaps expose a simple “status” endpoint or use performance counters) will help maintain uptime.

By following these practices, the integration with the smart contracts will be robust, secure, and efficient. The combination of on-chain logic with off-chain support code will deliver a smooth experience to the players, abstracting away blockchain complexity while preserving transparency (since players can always verify outcomes on-chain if they wish). With the technical architecture and plan detailed above, the development team can implement the mission game DApp in a structured and stepwise fashion, ensuring each piece (contracts, backend, frontend) works in harmony to achieve the desired gameplay.
