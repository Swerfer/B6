Each Mission clone is created with `clone.initialize(...)`\r\n *    and thereafter calls back into the factory for bookkeeping.\r\n *\r\n * ## 📖 Mission Overview\r\n * A Mission is a competitive game with three consecutive phases:\r\n *\r\n * 1. **Enrollment** (`enrollmentStart → enrollmentEnd`)  \r\n *    • Players pay `enrollmentAmount` once.  \r\n *    • Anti-addiction limits: max `weeklyLimit` per 7 days & `monthlyLimit`\r\n *      per 30 days – enforced by the factory.  \r\n *    • Mission requires `enrollmentMinPlayers` to arm; max is\r\n *      `enrollmentMaxPlayers`.\r\n *\r\n * 2. **Active** (`missionStart → missionEnd`)  \r\n *    • Consists of `missionRounds` payout rounds.  \r\n *    • A cooldown: 5 min after normal rounds, 1 min before the final round.  \r\n *    • A player can win **once per mission**.  \r\n *    • Each round’s payout = time-progress since last claim × `ethStart` / 100.\r\n *\r\n * 3. **End / Settle**  \r\n *    • Ends when all rounds are claimed **or** `missionEnd` passes.  \r\n *    • Owner/authorized may call `forceFinalizeMission()` if necessary.  \r\n *    • Remaining ETH is distributed via `_withdrawFunds()`.\r\n *\r\n * ## 🏭 MissionFactory Responsibilities\r\n * • **Deployment** – clones the Mission implementation (EIP-1167) and sends\r\n *   initial seed ETH.  \r\n * • **Status Tracking** – every Mission reports its status back via\r\n *   `setMissionStatus`; the factory stores this for dashboards and queries.  \r\n * • **Enrollment Limits** – global weekly / monthly caps checked in\r\n *   `canEnroll()` and recorded with `recordEnrollment()`.  \r\n * • **Reserved Funds Pool** – collects 75 % of leftover ETH from finished\r\n *   missions and redistributes part of it to newly-created games.  \r\n * • **Authorization Layer** – owner can whitelist helpers; `onlyOwnerOrAuthorized`\r\n *   guards all admin actions (create, withdraw, config).  \r\n * • **Registry** – `isMission[addr]` and `missionStatus[addr]` let the factory\r\n *   authenticate mission callbacks and list active / ended missions.\r\n *\r\n * ## 💰 Fee Split\r\n * • 25 % of post-game pot → factory owner.  \r\n * • 75 %                  → factory reserve (`reservedFunds[missionType]`).\r\n *\r\n * ## 🔄 Refund & Failure Logic\r\n * • If a mission never arms (not enough players) all enrollments are refunded.  \r\n * • If ETH transfers to players fail, amounts are parked in\r\n *   `failedRefundAmounts`; .\r\n *\r\n * ## ⚠️ Key Constraints\r\n * • `missionRounds` ≥ `enrollmentMinPlayers`.  \r\n * • A player can win at most once per mission.\r\n *\r\n * ## 🛠 Admin Functions (Mission level)\r\n * • `armMission`, `forceFinalizeMission`, `withdrawFunds`, `refundPlayers`.\r\n *\r\n * ## ✅ Security\r\n * • OpenZeppelin **Ownable** + **ReentrancyGuard**.  \r\n * • ETH transfers via `.call{value: …}` to forward all gas and avoid\r\n *   griefing.  \r\n * • Factory verifies that callbacks come from registered missions\r\n *   (`onlyMission`).\r\n *\r\n * @dev Each Mission is an EIP-1167 minimal proxy deployed by MissionFactory.\r\n */\r\n// ───────────────────── Imports ────────────────────────\r\nimport \"@openzeppelin/contracts/access/Ownable.sol\";\r\nimport \"@openzeppelin/contracts/proxy/Clones.sol\";\r\nimport \"@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/ReentrancyGuard.sol\";\r\n\r\n// ─────────────────── Global Enums ─────────────────────\r\n/**\r\n * @dev Enum to represent the type of mission.\r\n * The mission can be one of several types: Custom, Hourly, QuarterDaily, BiDaily, Daily, Weekly, or Monthly.\r\n */\r\nenum MissionType {\r\n    Custom,\r\n    Hourly,\r\n    QuarterDaily,\r\n    BiDaily,\r\n    Daily,\r\n    Weekly,\r\n    Monthly\r\n}\r\n\r\n/**\r\n * @dev Enum to represent the status of a mission.\r\n * The mission can be in one of several states: Pending, Enrolling, Active, Paused, Ended, or Failed.\r\n */\r\nenum Status {\r\n    Pending,\r\n    Enrolling,\r\n    Active,\r\n    Paused,\r\n    Ended,\r\n    Failed\r\n}\r\n\r\n// ────────────── Contract MissionFactory────────────────\r\ncontract MissionFactory is Ownable, ReentrancyGuard {\r\n    using Clones    for address;\r\n    \r\n    // ────────────────── Events ───────────────────────\r\n    /** \r\n     * @dev Events emitted by the MissionFactory contract.\r\n     * These events are used to log important actions and state changes within the contract.\r\n     */\r\n    event AuthorizedAddressAdded                (address        indexed addr                                                                        );\r\n    event AuthorizedAddressRemoved              (address        indexed addr                                                                        );\r\n    event MissionCreated                        (address        indexed missionAddress, MissionType indexed missionType                             );\r\n    event FundsReceived                         (address        indexed sender,         uint256             amount                                  );\r\n    event MissionFundsRegistered                (uint256                amount,         MissionType indexed missionType,    address indexed sender  );\r\n    event FundsWithdrawn                        (address        indexed to,             uint256             amount                                  );
