Once the mission starts, players compete in multiple rounds\r\n * to win portions of the prize pool. The game ends when all rounds are claimed or when\r\n * the mission duration expires.\r\n *\r\n * ## 🎮 Game Rules\r\n *\r\n * 1. **Enrollment Phase**\r\n *    - Starts at `enrollmentStart` and ends at `enrollmentEnd`.\r\n *    - Players pay `enrollmentAmount` to enroll.\r\n *    - Each address can enroll only once.\r\n *    - Each player is checked if they can enroll based on anti-addiction limits:\r\n *        - Weekly limit:  `weeklyLimit`  missions.\r\n *        - Monthly limit: `monthlyLimit` missions.\r\n *    - Enrollment succeeds only if the enrollment window is open and max players not reached.\r\n *\r\n * 2. **Start Conditions**\r\n *    - After `enrollmentEnd`, mission can only start if `enrollmentMinPlayers` is met.\r\n *    - If conditions fail, mission is marked as `Failed` and refunds are processed.\r\n *\r\n * 3. **Mission Phases**\r\n *    - **Active Phase**: Mission starts at `missionStart` and runs until `missionEnd`.\r\n *    - Mission consists of `missionRounds` rounds.\r\n *    - Each round can only be called after a cooldown:\r\n *        - **Normal rounds**: 5-minute pause after each round.\r\n *        - **Final round**: 1-minute pause before last round.\r\n *    - A player can only win **once per mission**.\r\n *\r\n * 4. **Round Payouts**\r\n *    - Prize pool starts as `ethStart` (initial ETH funding).\r\n *    - At each round, payout = (progress since last round) * `ethStart` / 100.\r\n *    - Progress = % of total mission duration elapsed since last claim.\r\n *    - Example:\r\n *        - If 10% of time passed since last claim, 10% of `ethStart` is paid out.\r\n *    - Remaining ETH after final round is swept during withdrawal.\r\n *\r\n * 5. **Mission End**\r\n *    - Mission ends when:\r\n *        - All rounds claimed OR\r\n *        - `missionEnd` timestamp reached.\r\n *    - If time expires with incomplete rounds:\r\n *        - Owner/authorized can call `forceFinalizeMission()`:\r\n *            - If some rounds called → Remaining ETH is swept during withdrawal.\r\n *            - If no rounds called → Mission is marked as `Failed`, all players refunded.\r\n *\r\n * 6. **Fees**\r\n *    - After mission completion (or failure):\r\n *        - 25% of remaining ETH → factory owner.\r\n *        - 75% → MissionFactory for future missions (reservedFunds).\r\n *    - Payout is processed in `_withdrawFunds()`.\r\n *\r\n * 7. **Refund Logic**\r\n *    - If mission fails (not enough players), all enrolled players get refunded.\r\n *    - If a refund fails (e.g., non-payable address), the amount is tracked in `failedRefundAmounts`.\r\n *    - Failed refunds are excluded from normal withdrawals unless `force = true` in `_withdrawFunds()`.\r\n *\r\n * ## ⚠️ Key Constraints\r\n * - `missionRounds` must be >= enrollmentMinPlayers.\r\n * - A player can only win once per mission.\r\n *\r\n * ## 🛠 Admin Functions\r\n * - Owner or authorized can:\r\n *    - Force finalize the mission after time expiry.\r\n *    - Withdraw leftover funds after mission end/failure.\r\n *\r\n * ## ✅ Security\r\n * - Uses OpenZeppelin ReentrancyGuard for state-changing functions.\r\n * - ETH transfers use `.call{value: ...}` to prevent gas griefing.\r\n * - Refund failures are logged and tracked for later withdrawal.\r\n *\r\n * @dev This contract is deployed as a clone (minimal proxy) by

Once the mission starts, players compete in multiple rounds\r\n * to win portions of the prize pool. The game ends when all rounds are claimed or when\r\n * the mission duration expires.\r\n *\r\n * ## 🎮 Game Rules\r\n *\r\n * 1. **Enrollment Phase**\r\n *    - Starts at `enrollmentStart` and ends at `enrollmentEnd`.\r\n *    - Players pay `enrollmentAmount` to enroll.\r\n *    - Each address can enroll only once.\r\n *    - Each player is checked if they can enroll based on anti-addiction limits:\r\n *        - Weekly limit:  `weeklyLimit`  missions.\r\n *        - Monthly limit: `monthlyLimit` missions.\r\n *    - Enrollment succeeds only if the enrollment window is open and max players not reached.\r\n *\r\n * 2. **Start Conditions**\r\n *    - After `enrollmentEnd`, mission can only start if `enrollmentMinPlayers` is met.\r\n *    - If conditions fail, mission is marked as `Failed` and refunds are processed.\r\n *\r\n * 3. **Mission Phases**\r\n *    - **Active Phase**: Mission starts at `missionStart` and runs until `missionEnd`.\r\n *    - Mission consists of `missionRounds` rounds.\r\n *    - Each round can only be called after a cooldown:\r\n *        - **Normal rounds**: 5-minute pause after each round.\r\n *        - **Final round**: 1-minute pause before last round.\r\n *    - A player can only win **once per mission**.\r\n *\r\n * 4. **Round Payouts**\r\n *    - Prize pool starts as `ethStart` (initial ETH funding).\r\n *    - At each round, payout = (progress since last round) * `ethStart` / 100.\r\n *    - Progress = % of total mission duration elapsed since last claim.\r\n *    - Example:\r\n *        - If 10% of time passed since last claim, 10% of `ethStart` is paid out.\r\n *    - Remaining ETH after final round is swept during withdrawal.\r\n *\r\n * 5. **Mission End**\r\n *    - Mission ends when:\r\n *        - All rounds claimed OR\r\n *        - `missionEnd` timestamp reached.\r\n *    - If time expires with incomplete rounds:\r\n *        - Owner/authorized can call `forceFinalizeMission()`:\r\n *            - If some rounds called → Remaining ETH is swept during withdrawal.\r\n *            - If no rounds called → Mission is marked as `Failed`, all players refunded.\r\n *\r\n * 6. **Fees**\r\n *    - After mission completion (or failure):\r\n *        - 25% of remaining ETH → factory owner.\r\n *        - 75% → MissionFactory for future missions (reservedFunds).\r\n *    - Payout is processed in `_withdrawFunds()`.\r\n *\r\n * 7. **Refund Logic**\r\n *    - If mission fails (not enough players), all enrolled players get refunded.\r\n *    - If a refund fails (e.g., non-payable address), the amount is tracked in `failedRefundAmounts`.\r\n *    - Failed refunds are excluded from normal withdrawals unless `force = true` in `_withdrawFunds()`.\r\n *\r\n * ## ⚠️ Key Constraints\r\n * - `missionRounds` must be >= enrollmentMinPlayers.\r\n * - A player can only win once per mission.\r\n *\r\n * ## 🛠 Admin Functions\r\n * - Owner or authorized can:\r\n *    - Force finalize the mission after time expiry.\r\n *    - Withdraw leftover funds after mission end/failure.\r\n *\r\n * ## ✅ Security\r\n * - Uses OpenZeppelin ReentrancyGuard for state-changing functions.\r\n * - ETH transfers use `.call{value: ...}` to prevent gas griefing.\r\n * - Refund failures are logged and tracked for later withdrawal.\r\n *\r\n * @dev This contract is deployed as a clone (minimal proxy) by MissionFactory.\r\n */\r\n\r\ncontract Mission is Ownable, ReentrancyGuard {\r\n    \r\n    // ───────────────────── Events ─────────────────────\r\n    event MissionStatusChanged  (Status     indexed previousStatus, Status      indexed newStatus,      uint256 timestamp                   );\r\n    event PlayerEnrolled        (address    indexed player,         uint256             amount,         uint256 totalPlayers                );\r\n    event MissionArmed          (uint256            timestamp,      uint256             totalPlayers                                        );\r\n    event RoundCalled           (address    indexed player,         uint8       indexed roundNumber,    uint256 payout, uint256 ethRemaining);\r\n    event PlayerRefunded        (address    indexed player,         uint256             amount                                              );\r\n    event FundsWithdrawn        (uint256            ownerAmount,    uint256             factoryAmount                                       );\r\n    event MissionPaused         (uint256            timestamp                                                                               );\r\n    event MissionResumed        (uint256            timestamp                                                                               );\r\n    event RefundFailed          (address    indexed player,         uint256             amount                                              );

@title Be Brave Be Bold Be Banked (B6) Mission Game Smart Contract\n @notice This contract represents a single \"Mission\" in the game system deployed via MissionFactory.\n ## 📖 Overview\n A Mission is a time-based competitive game where players enroll by paying a fixed ETH amount\n during the enrollment period. Once the mission starts, players compete in multiple rounds\n to win portions of the prize pool. The game ends when all rounds are claimed or when\n the mission duration expires.\n ## 🎮 Game Rules\n 1. **Enrollment Phase**\n    - Starts at `enrollmentStart` and ends at `enrollmentEnd`.\n    - Players pay `enrollmentAmount` to enroll.\n    - Each address can enroll only once.\n    - Each player is checked if they can enroll based on anti-addiction limits:\n        - Weekly limit:  `weeklyLimit`  missions.\n        - Monthly limit: `monthlyLimit` missions.\n    - Enrollment succeeds only if the enrollment window is open and max players not reached.\n 2. **Start Conditions**\n    - After `enrollmentEnd`, mission can only start if `enrollmentMinPlayers` is met.\n    - If conditions fail, mission is marked as `Failed` and refunds are processed.\n 3. **Mission Phases**\n    - **Active Phase**: Mission starts at `missionStart` and runs until `missionEnd`.\n    - Mission consists of `missionRounds` rounds.\n    - Each round can only be called after a cooldown:\n        - **Normal rounds**: 5-minute pause after each round.\n        - **Final round**: 1-minute pause before last round.\n    - A player can only win **once per mission**.\n 4. **Round Payouts**\n    - Prize pool starts as `ethStart` (initial ETH funding).\n    - At each round, payout = (progress since last round) * `ethStart` / 100.\n    - Progress = % of total mission duration elapsed since last claim.\n    - Example:\n        - If 10% of time passed since last claim, 10% of `ethStart` is paid out.\n    - Remaining ETH after final round is swept during withdrawal.\n 5. **Mission End**\n    - Mission ends when:\n        - All rounds claimed OR\n        - `missionEnd` timestamp reached.\n    - If time expires with incomplete rounds:\n        - Owner/authorized can call `forceFinalizeMission()`:\n            - If some rounds called → Remaining ETH is swept during withdrawal.\n            - If no rounds called → Mission is marked as `Failed`, all players refunded.\n 6. **Fees**\n    - After mission completion (or failure):\n        - 25% of remaining ETH → factory owner.\n        - 75% → MissionFactory for future missions (reservedFunds).\n    - Payout is processed in `_withdrawFunds()`.\n 7. **Refund Logic**\n    - If mission fails (not enough players), all enrolled players get refunded.\n    - If a refund fails (e.g., non-payable address), the amount is tracked in `failedRefundAmounts`.\n    - Failed refunds are excluded from normal withdrawals unless `force = true` in `_withdrawFunds()`.\n ## ⚠️ Key Constraints\n - `missionRounds` must be >= enrollmentMinPlayers.\n - A player can only win once per mission.\n ## 🛠 Admin Functions\n - Owner or authorized can:\n    - Force finalize the mission after time expiry.\n    - Withdraw leftover funds after mission end/failure.\n ## ✅ Security\n - Uses OpenZeppelin ReentrancyGuard for state-changing functions.\n - ETH transfers use `.call{value: ...}` to prevent gas griefing.\n - Refund failures are logged and tracked for later withdrawal.\n @dev This contract is deployed as a clone (minimal proxy) by MissionFactory."},"fullyImplemented":true,"id":3538,"linearizedBaseContracts":[3538,766,147,576],"name":"Mission","nameLocation":"34172:7:6","nodeType":"ContractDefinition","nodes":[{"anonymous":false,"eventSelector":"39ba628632d48c45c7f562c07db20a44cf68423691d5d79b20f87ba84138aedf","id":2272,"name":"MissionStatusChanged","nameLocation":"34370:20:6","nodeType":"EventDefinition","parameters":{"id":2271,"nodeType":"ParameterList","parameters":[{"constant":false,"id":2265,"indexed":true,"mutability":"mutable","name":"previousStatus","nameLocation":"34412:14:6","nodeType":"VariableDeclaration","scope":2272,"src":"34393:33:6","stateVariable":false,"storageLocation":"default","typeDescriptions":{"typeIdentifier":"t_enum$_Status_$788","typeString":"enum

Once the mission starts, players compete in multiple rounds to win portions of the prize pool. The game ends when all rounds are claimed or when the mission duration expires. ## \\ud83c\\udfae Game Rules 1. **Enrollment Phase**    - Starts at `enrollmentStart` and ends at `enrollmentEnd`.    - Players pay `enrollmentAmount` to enroll.    - Each address can enroll only once.    - Each player is checked if they can enroll based on anti-addiction limits:        - Weekly limit:  `weeklyLimit`  missions.        - Monthly limit: `monthlyLimit` missions.    - Enrollment succeeds only if the enrollment window is open and max players not reached. 2. **Start Conditions**    - After `enrollmentEnd`, mission can only start if `enrollmentMinPlayers` is met.    - If conditions fail, mission is marked as `Failed` and refunds are processed. 3. **Mission Phases**    - **Active Phase**: Mission starts at `missionStart` and runs until `missionEnd`.    - Mission consists of `missionRounds` rounds.    - Each round can only be called after a cooldown:        - **Normal rounds**: 5-minute pause after each round.        - **Final round**: 1-minute pause before last round.    - A player can only win **once per mission**. 4. **Round Payouts**    - Prize pool starts as `ethStart` (initial ETH funding).    - At each round, payout = (progress since last round) * `ethStart` / 100.    - Progress = % of total mission duration elapsed since last claim.    - Example:        - If 10% of time passed since last claim, 10% of `ethStart` is paid out.    - Remaining ETH after final round is swept during withdrawal. 5. **Mission End**    - Mission ends when:        - All rounds claimed OR        - `missionEnd` timestamp reached.    - If time expires with incomplete rounds:        - Owner/authorized can call `forceFinalizeMission()`:            - If some rounds called \\u2192 Remaining ETH is swept during withdrawal.            - If no rounds called \\u2192 Mission is marked as `Failed`, all players refunded. 6. **Fees**    - After mission completion (or failure):        - 25% of remaining ETH \\u2192 factory owner.        - 75% \\u2192 MissionFactory for future missions (reservedFunds).    - Payout is processed in `_withdrawFunds()`. 7. **Refund Logic**    - If mission fails (not enough players), all enrolled players get refunded.    - If a refund fails (e.g., non-payable address), the amount is tracked in `failedRefundAmounts`.    - Failed refunds are excluded from normal withdrawals unless `force = true` in `_withdrawFunds()`. ## \\u26a0\\ufe0f Key Constraints - `missionRounds` must be >= enrollmentMinPlayers. - A player can only win once per mission. ## \\ud83d\\udee0 Admin Functions - Owner or authorized can:    - Force finalize the mission after time expiry.    - Withdraw leftover funds after mission end/failure. ## \\u2705 Security - Uses OpenZeppelin ReentrancyGuard for state-changing functions. - ETH transfers use `.call{value: ...}` to prevent gas griefing. - Refund failures are logged and tracked for later withdrawal.\",\"version\":1}},\"settings\":{\"compilationTarget\":{\"contracts/MissionFactory.sol\":\"Mission\"},\"evmVersion\":\"paris\",\"libraries\":{},\"metadata\":{\"bytecodeHash\":\"ipfs\"},\"optimizer\":{\"enabled\":true,\"runs\":200},\"remappings\":[],\"viaIR\":true},\"sources\":{\"@openzeppelin/contracts/access/Ownable.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0xff6d0bb2e285473e5311d9d3caacb525ae3538a80758c10649a4d61029b017bb\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://8ed324d3920bb545059d66ab97d43e43ee85fd3bd52e03e401f020afb0b120f6\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmfEckWLmZkDDcoWrkEvMWhms66xwTLff9DDhegYpvHo1a\"]},\"@openzeppelin/contracts/proxy/Clones.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0x7e918671c04972845975935ea13c9ce0be1228031ba0e929d0f1f68fd1f17214\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://3027ebaeef3e678ad9bae26f0556469878e992bf7dec94bede328a92be529419\",\"dweb:/ipfs/Qmdu4RfMYv9Q7iHWuYfyUL6fZKc73nM4YWizNP8w1xay56\"]},\"@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/Context.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0x493033a8d1b176a037b2cc6a04dad01a5c157722049bbecf632ca876224dd4b2\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://6a708e8a5bdb1011c2c381c9a5cfd8a9a956d7d0a9dc1bd8bcdaf52f76ef2f12\",\"dweb:/ipfs/Qmax9WHBnVsZP46ZxEMNRQpLQnrdE4dK8LehML1Py8FowF\"]},\"@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/Create2.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0xbb7e8401583d26268ea9103013bcdcd90866a7718bd91105ebd21c9bf11f4f06\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://866a11ad89c93ee918078f7a46ae31e17d89216ce64603f0d34be7ed0a5c520e\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmW3ckLEJg2v2NzuVLNJFmRuerGSipw6Dzg6ntbmqbAGoC\"]},\"@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/Errors.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0x6afa713bfd42cf0f7656efa91201007ac465e42049d7de1d50753a373648c123\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://ba1d02f4847670a1b83dec9f7d37f0b0418d6043447b69f3a29a5f9efc547fcf\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmQ7iH2keLNUKgq2xSWcRmuBE5eZ3F5whYAkAGzCNNoEWB\"]},\"@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/ReentrancyGuard.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0x11a5a79827df29e915a12740caf62fe21ebe27c08c9ae3e09abe9ee3ba3866d3\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://3cf0c69ab827e3251db9ee6a50647d62c90ba580a4d7bbff21f2bea39e7b2f4a\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmZiKwtKU1SBX4RGfQtY7PZfiapbbu6SZ9vizGQD9UHjRA\"]},\"contracts/MissionFactory.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0x8366e7bc04c657c44bd618fa64ddd1c9695eccaf3afc8e969490c07c831bfe4a\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://0f5d86579acb3854221d3ddce28cae23e2a64f06634dd56ae41708bc04372301\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmZC75rXTBtj3ibTjupGXuX3zpnc5x8EWM4YJpVgbWXGuM\"]}},\"version\":1}"},"MissionFactory":{"abi":[{"inputs":[],"stateMutability":"nonpayable","type":"constructor"},{"inputs":[],"name":"FailedDeployment","type":"error"},{"inputs":[{"internalType":"uint256","name":"balance","type":"uint256"},{"internalType":"uint256","name":"needed","type":"uint256"}],"name":"InsufficientBalance","type":"error"},{"inputs":[{"internalType":"address","name":"owner","type":"address"}],"name":"OwnableInvalidOwner","type":"error"},{"inputs":[{"internalType":"address","name":"account","type":"address"}],"name":"OwnableUnauthorizedAccount","type":"error"},{"inputs":[],"name":"ReentrancyGuardReentrantCall","type":"error"},{"anonymous":false,"inputs":[{"indexed":true,"internalType":"address","name":"addr","type":"address"}],"name":"AuthorizedAddressAdded","type":"event"},{"anonymous":false,"inputs":[{"indexed":true,"internalType":"address","name":"addr","type":"address"}],"name":"AuthorizedAddressRemoved","type":"event"},{"anonymous":false,"inputs":[{"indexed":false,"internalType":"uint8","name":"newWeekly","type":"uint8"},{"indexed":false,"internalType":"uint8","name":"newMonthly","type":"uint8"}],"name":"EnrollmentLimitUpdated","type":"event"},{"anonymous":false,"inputs":[{"indexed":true,"internalType":"address","name":"user","type":"address"},{"indexed":false,"internalType":"uint256","name":"timestamp","type":"uint256"}],"name":"EnrollmentRecorded","type":"event"},{"anonymous":false,"inputs":[{"indexed":true,"internalType":"address","name":"sender","type":"address"},{"indexed":false,"internalType":"uint256","name":"amount","type":"uint256"}],"name":"FundsReceived","type":"event"},{"anonymous":false,"inputs":[{"indexed":true,"internalType":"address","name":"to","type":"address"},{"indexed":false,"internalType":"uint256","name":"amount","type":"uint256"}],"name":"FundsWithdrawn","type":"event"},{"anonymous":false,"inputs":[{"indexed":true,"internalType":"address","name":"missionAddress","type":"address"},{"indexed":true,"internalType":"enum
