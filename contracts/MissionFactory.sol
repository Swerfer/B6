 * @title   Be Brave Be Bold Be Banked‚Ñ¢ ‚Äì Mission & Factory Architecture
 * @author  B6 Labs‚Ñ¢ ‚Äì Swerfer
 *
 * @notice
 * ## üß© Components (this file)
 * - **MissionFactory** ‚Äî deploys EIP-1167 clones of `Mission`, tracks status,
 *   enforces weekly/monthly enrollment limits, routes economics, and manages
 *   a per-type reserve of leftover funds.
 * - **Mission** ‚Äî a time-boxed game with linear, monotonic payouts and
 *   cooldowns between rounds.
 *
 * ## üîå External dependencies
 * OpenZeppelin `Ownable`, `ReentrancyGuard`, `Clones`, and `Strings`.
 *
 * ## üîÅ Lifecycle & real-time status
 * The on-chain lifecycle is expressed by `enum Status` and computed on demand:
 * `Pending ‚Üí Enrolling ‚Üí Arming ‚Üí Active ‚Üî Paused ‚Üí (PartlySuccess | Success | Failed)`.
 * - **Pending**: clone exists, before enrollment opens.
 * - **Enrolling**: `enrollmentStart..enrollmentEnd`. Players pay `enrollmentAmount` once.
 * - **Arming**: minimum players reached, waiting for `missionStart`.
 * - **Active**: `missionStart..missionEnd`. On each successful round call, one distinct player wins.
 * - **Paused**: enforced cooldown after a round; duration is per-mission.
 * - **PartlySuccess/Success/Failed**: terminal outcomes used for settlement paths.
 *
 * ## üë• Enrollment limits (anti-addiction)
 * The factory enforces global weekly/monthly limits per address via `canEnroll()` and
 * records enrollments with `recordEnrollment()`. Helper views:
 * `secondsTillWeeklySlot()` and `secondsTillMonthlySlot()`.
 *
 * ## üí∞ Payout model (monotonic and time-based)
 * Let `progress = (now - missionStart) / (missionEnd - missionStart)` (scaled).
 * The **cumulative entitlement** is `croStart * progress`. The round payout equals
 * `entitlement - paidSoFar`, clamped to `croCurrent`. A player may win **once** per mission.
 *
 * ## ‚è± Cooldowns
 * Two per-mission parameters are provided during creation:
 * - `roundPauseDuration` ‚Äî cooldown after non-final rounds (seconds).
 * - `lastRoundPauseDuration` ‚Äî cooldown before the final round (seconds).
 * **Note:** there are **no enforced on-chain defaults**; any ‚Äú1 minute‚Äù defaults are a UI choice.
 *
 * ## üîí InviteOnly secret enrollment
 * InviteOnly missions verify a **private commitment** `_enrollSecretHash`,
 * computed off-chain as `keccak256(passphrase, enrollmentStart)`. The hash is stored
 * **privately** on the mission (not in public `MissionData`) and checked in
 * `enrollPlayerWithSecret(passphrase)`.
 *
 * ## üè¶ Economics & settlement
 * After refunds are secured/reserved:
 * - **InviteOnly**: **100%** of leftover goes to the **factory owner**
 * - **UserMission**: **50%** to the factory owner; **50%** to the **creator**
 * - **Other types**: **25%** to the factory owner; **75%** to the **per-type reserve**
 *   `reservedFunds[missionType]`.
 * On creating a new mission, the factory **optionally boosts** it with
 * `allocation = reservedFunds[type] / 4`, sent to the mission via `increasePot()`.
 *
 * ## üßæ Ownership & authorization
 * The factory owner can add/remove authorized helpers and manage a two-step ownership
 * transfer (`proposeOwnershipTransfer` / `confirmOwnershipTransfer`). Sensitive functions
 * are protected by `onlyOwner`, `onlyOwnerOrAuthorized`, and `nonReentrant` where applicable.
 *
 * ## üß≠ What to look for in the code
 * - Factory: clone deployment, reserve accounting, enrollment limit bookkeeping,
 *   rich getters for dApps/indexers.
 * - Mission: initialize, enroll (normal & secret), round calling, cooldown checks,
 *   refunds, settlement routing, and detailed views for indexers.
